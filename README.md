## Shoppy - An E-Commerce Platform

The E-Commerce Platform project aims to create a modern and feature-rich online platform for buying and selling products. With the exponential growth of e-commerce, this project leverages the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack to provide a scalable, secure, and user-friendly e-commerce experience. This proposal outlines the objectives, modules, data structures, database design, tools/platforms, hardware/software requirements, and future scope of the project. This project is envisioned to create an online platform that will provide users with a seamless and secure shopping experience.
